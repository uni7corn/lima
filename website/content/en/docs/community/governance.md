<!-- The governance model is similar to https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md but simplified -->

## Code of Conduct
Lima follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Maintainership
Lima is governed by Maintainers who are elected from active contributors.

As a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) project, Lima will keep its [vendor-neutrality](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/).

### Roles
Maintainers consist of two roles:

- **Committer** (Full maintainership): Committers have full write accesses to repos under <https://github.com/lima-vm>.
  Committers' commits should still be made via GitHub pull requests (except for urgent security fixes), and should not be pushed directly.
  Committers must enable 2FA for their GitHub accounts.
  Committers are also recognized as Maintainers in <https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv>.

- **Reviewer** (Limited maintainership): Reviewers may moderate GitHub issues and pull requests (such as adding labels and cleaning up spams),
  but they do not have any access to merge pull requests nor push commits.
  A Reviewer is considered as a candidate to become a Committer.
  Reviewers are not recognized as Maintainers in <https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv>.

See also the [Contributing](../contributing) page.

### Addition and promotion of Maintainers
An active contributor to the project can be invited as a Reviewer,
and can be eventually promoted to a Committer after 2 months at least.

A contributor who have made significant contributions in quality and in quantity
can be also directly invited as a Committer.

A proposal to add or promote a Maintainer must be approved by 2/3 of the Committers who vote within 7 days.
Voting needs 2 approvals at least. The proposer can vote too.

A proposal should happen as a GitHub pull request to the Maintainer list above.
It is highly suggested to reach out to the Committers before submitting a pull request to check the will of the Committers.

### Removal and demotion of Maintainers
A Maintainer who do not show significant activities for 6 months, or, who have been violating the Code of Conduct,
may be demoted or removed from the project.

A proposal to demote or remove a Maintainer must be approved by 2/3 of the Committers (excluding the person in question) who vote within 14 days.
Voting needs 2 approvals at least. The proposer can vote too.

A proposal may happen as a GitHub pull request, or, as a private discussion in the case of removal of a harmful Maintainer.
It is highly suggested to reach out to the Committers before submitting a pull request to check the will of the Committers.

### Other decisions
Any decision that is not documented here can be made by the Committers.
When a dispute happens across the Committers, it will be resolved through a majority vote within the Committers.
A tie should be considered as a failed vote.

## Release process

Eligibility to be a release manager:
- MUST be an active Committer
- MUST have the GPG fingerprint listed in the maintainer list above
- MUST upload the GPG public key to `https://github.com/USERNAME.gpg`
- MUST protect the GPG key with a passphrase or a hardware token.

Release steps:
- Open an issue to propose making a new release, e.g. <https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues/2296>.
  The proposal should be public, with an exception for vulnerability fixes.
  If this is the first time for you to take a role of release management,
  you SHOULD make a beta (or alpha, RC) release as an exercise before releasing GA.
- Make sure that all the merged PRs are associated with the correct [Milestone](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/milestones).
- Run `git tag --sign vX.Y.Z-beta.W` .
- Run `git push UPSTREAM vX.Y.Z-beta.W` .
- Wait for the `Release` action on GitHub Actions to complete. A draft release will appear in https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/releases .
- Download `SHA256SUMS` from the draft release, and confirm that it corresponds to the hashes printed in the build logs on the `Release` action.
- Sign `SHA256SUMS` with `gpg --detach-sign -a SHA256SUMS` to produce `SHA256SUMS.asc`, and upload it to the draft release.
- Add release notes in the draft release, to explain the changes and show appreciation to the contributors.
  Make sure to fulfill the `Release manager: [ADD YOUR NAME HERE] (@[ADD YOUR GITHUB ID HERE])` line with your name.
  e.g., `Release manager: Akihiro Suda (@AkihiroSuda)` .
- Click the `Set as a pre-release` checkbox if this release is a beta (or alpha, RC).
- Click the `Publish release` button.
- Close the [Milestone](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/milestones).
